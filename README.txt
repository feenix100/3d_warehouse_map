I am creating a three dimensional map of the shelves in a machine parts distribution warehouse. There are about 12 rows of shelves in the warehouse. 

Each shelf is filled with parts that are labeled and organized using numbers, four to six digits in length. Example 8421, 100201.

The goal is to use code to create an easy to update and edit 3 dimensional map that can be run fast and easy on multiple computer systems.

I will attempt to use three.js to accomplish this.
